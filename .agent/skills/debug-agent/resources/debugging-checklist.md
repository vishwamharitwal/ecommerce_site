## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Read the error message** - It usually tells you exactly what's wrong
2. **Reproduce first** - Don't waste time fixing unconfirmed bugs
3. **One change at a time** - Don't fix multiple things simultaneously
4. **Test thoroughly** - Verify the fix and check for regressions
5. **Document everything** - Future you will be grateful
6. **Look for patterns** - One bug often reveals more
