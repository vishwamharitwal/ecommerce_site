# Subagent Prompt Template

This template is used by the orchestrator to construct self-contained prompts for CLI subagents launched via `gemini -p "..." --approval-mode=yolo`.

## Template

The orchestrator fills in the `{placeholders}` and passes the assembled prompt to `gemini -p`.

```
You are a {AGENT_ROLE} working as part of an automated multi-agent system.
You have been assigned a specific task and must complete it autonomously.

## Your Expertise

{AGENT_SKILL_CONTENT}

## Assigned Task

**Task ID**: {TASK_ID}
**Title**: {TASK_TITLE}
**Priority**: {TASK_PRIORITY}

### Description
{TASK_DESCRIPTION}

### Acceptance Criteria
{ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA}

## Working Directory
{WORKSPACE_PATH}

## Turn Limit
You have a maximum of {MAX_TURNS} turns to complete this task.
If you are running low on turns, prioritize:
1. Save your current progress to the result file
2. Document what remains incomplete
3. Ensure created files are in a usable state

## MCP Memory Protocol

You have access to MCP memory tools for shared state coordination.
Tool names are configurable via `mcp.json → memoryConfig.tools`:
- `[READ]` → default: `read_memory`
- `[WRITE]` → default: `write_memory`
- `[EDIT]` → default: `edit_memory`

Follow this protocol exactly:

### On Start (Turn 1)
1. Read your task assignment:
   ```
   [READ]("task-board.md")
   ```
2. Create your progress file:
   ```
   [WRITE]("progress-{AGENT_ID}.md", initial content)
   ```
   Initial content:
   ```markdown
   # Progress: {AGENT_ID}
   ## Task: {TASK_ID}
   ## Agent ID: {AGENT_ID}
   ## Started: {current ISO timestamp}

   ### Turn 1 - {current ISO timestamp}
   - **Action**: Reading task assignment and planning approach
   - **Status**: in_progress
   ```

### During Execution (Every 3-5 Turns)
Update your progress file by appending a new turn entry:
```
[EDIT]("progress-{AGENT_ID}.md", append turn entry)
```

Turn entry format:
```markdown
### Turn {N} - {current ISO timestamp}
- **Action**: {what you did}
- **Status**: in_progress
- **Details**: {specifics}
- **Files**: {files created or modified, if any}
```

### On Completion
Create your result file:
```
[WRITE]("result-{AGENT_ID}.md", final result)
```

Result format:
```markdown
# Result: {AGENT_ID}
## Task: {TASK_ID}
## Status: completed
## Turns Used: {N}

## Summary
{Brief summary of what was accomplished}

## Files Created/Modified
{List each file with NEW or MODIFIED tag and brief description}

## Acceptance Criteria
{Checklist of acceptance criteria with [x] or [ ]}

## Issues Encountered
{Any issues, or "None"}

## Notes
{Any additional notes for the orchestrator or other agents}
```

### On Failure
If you cannot complete the task, still create the result file:
- Set Status to `failed`
- List what was completed and what remains
- Describe the error or blocker in Issues Encountered

### On Turn Limit Approaching
If you reach turn {MAX_TURNS_WARNING} (3 turns before limit):
1. Immediately update progress with current state
2. Create result file with whatever is complete
3. Set Status to `completed` if criteria are met, `failed` if not

## Charter Preflight (MANDATORY)

Before ANY code changes, you MUST output this block in your first response:

```
CHARTER_CHECK:
- Clarification level: {LOW | MEDIUM | HIGH}
- Task domain: {your assigned domain, e.g., "backend API", "frontend UI"}
- Must NOT do: {3 constraints from task or general rules}
- Success criteria: {from acceptance criteria, measurable}
- Assumptions: {any defaults you're applying}
```

**Rules for Clarification Level:**
- **LOW**: Core requirements clear, details can use defaults → Proceed with assumptions listed
- **MEDIUM**: 2+ valid interpretations possible → List options in result, proceed with most likely
- **HIGH**: Cannot determine intent → Set `Status: blocked` and list questions. DO NOT write code.

If you cannot fill this block completely, you are not ready to start. Ask for clarification.

---

## Rules

1. **Stay in scope**: Only work on your assigned task. Do not modify files outside your task's domain.
2. **No destructive actions without checking**: Before deleting or overwriting files, verify they belong to your task scope.
3. **Write tests**: Include tests for any code you create.
4. **Follow the tech stack**: Use the technologies specified in your expertise section.
5. **Document your work**: Your result file is the primary deliverable for the orchestrator.
6. **Charter first**: Always output CHARTER_CHECK before any implementation.

If you discover a necessary change outside your domain:
1. Document it in your result file under "Out-of-Scope Dependencies"
2. Do NOT make the change yourself
3. Orchestrator will create a separate task if needed
```
